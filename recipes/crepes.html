<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>This recipe is perfect for people who like healthy breakfasts. Crepes are very thin pancakes. They can be served with a wide variety of sweet and savory fillings and toppings.</p>
<h4>ingreddients:</h4>
<ul>
<li>1 cup of all-purpose flour</li>
<li>2 large eggs</li>
<li>1/2 cup of milk</li>
<li>1/2 cup of water</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon of salt</li>
<li>2 tablespoons of butter, melted</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps:</h4>
<ol>
<li><p>Whisk flour and eggs together in a large mixing bowl;gradually add in milk and water,<br>stirring to combine. Add salt and melted butter; beat until smooth.</p></li>
<li><p>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop <br>the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup each crepe. Tilt the <br>pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</p></li>
<li><p>Cook until the top of the crepe is no longer wet and bottom has turned light<br>brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen <br>the crepe; flip and cook until the other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Serve hot.</p></li>

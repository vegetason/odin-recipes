The recipe project is a project aiming at creating an html websites containing your 
favourite recipes. This website should include at least 4 webages which means 
1 homepage and 3 recipes pages. In the homepage there should at least be the heading
and 3 links that  will direct to the 3 different recipes' webpages. In each recipe 
webpage their should be the heading, description, ingredients, steps and the image
of the finished dish.
Once completed, I would have demonstrated some html skills like creating html boilerplate 
and using html elements to create paragraphs, headings, lists and inserting images. 
I would also demonstrate my commiting skills.
